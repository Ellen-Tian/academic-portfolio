# 🌐 Aohua Tian – Academic Portfolio Website

This repository hosts my personal academic website, built to showcase my research, publications, and experience in **Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)**, **Vision–Language Models (VLMs)**, and **Urban Sustainability**.  
The site follows accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA) and uses a minimalist glassmorphism design with smooth transitions, responsive layout, and flexible component structure.
